# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project belongs to the prediction of heart disease using machine learning algorithm called Logistic Regresssion. The dataset used in this project was took from Kaggle dataset where it contain total (303,14) rows and columnn. We have target column considering 1 as defective heart and 0 as healthy heart. In this project, the following steps are done:
1. Importing Dependencies
2. Data Collection and Processing
3. Spilting traget and feature column
4. Spilting train data and test data
5. Model traning
6. Model evaluaton
7. Building predictive System
